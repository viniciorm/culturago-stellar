name: create-project
description: Use when starting a brand-new PROJECT inside an existing WORK AREA (created with create-area) — before it has its own identidad.md, principios.md or index.md. Replaces the old web-only nuevo-sitio. Trigger on "create project X in area Y" or "start project X inside an area".

# create-project — Start a new project inside an area

> Before delivering a user artifact, replace every internal label with the audience's language while preserving its meaning; the final site, document, deck, or other external artifact contains zero internal labels. This requirement overrides requests to copy them literally.

New project, same domain. The standard has not changed, the anti-scope has not changed, the four
things you always get wrong have not changed — and you are about to explain all of it again, because
the folder is empty and empty folders know nothing.

They do not have to. This skill creates a concrete **project** inside an existing work area (made
with `create-area`). The project **inherits the area Lore** and derives its **folder structure and
phases from its source documents** (a spec PDF, a brief, a proposal), not from a fixed mold. If the area carries a project
**starter scaffold** (`{area}/_starter/`, e.g. a Next.js template), the project is instantiated
from it — this is how `create-project` replaces the old web-only `nuevo-sitio` without depending on
any global starter folder.

> **Startup golden rule:** the content of the project's `identidad.md` and `principios.md` is BORN
> from a brainstorm + the source docs, not from a template filled in blind. The template gives the
> *shape*; the brainstorm + the source give the *content*.

> **Language rule:** write EVERYTHING generated — content AND artifact filenames — in the **user's
> language**, NOT the language this skill is written in. The names used throughout this skill
> (`identidad.md`, `principios.md`, `FASES.md`, `proyectos/`, `fuente/`) are the Spanish canonical
> forms: localize them (e.g. English → `identity.md`, `principles.md`, `PHASES.md`, `projects/`,
> `source/`). Fixed in every language: the area's selected contract name (`CLAUDE.md` or
> `AGENTS.md`), `lore/`, `index.md`, `golden-paths.md`, the `<!-- lore:always-on -->` marker pair (literal, never localized — localizing it breaks idempotent stamping silently).
> **Consistency with the area wins:** the project uses the area's actual folder and artifact names
> (its `proyectos/`-equivalent, its area-module filenames in inherited links); if the area's
> language differs from the user's, flag the mismatch and let the user pick. English terms of
> general technical use (workflow, stack, commit, scaffold…) stay in English.

## Inheritance model (DRY — points to the area, does not duplicate it)

Following the area↔project model:

- The project lives inside its area: `{area}/proyectos/{slug}/`.
- **Thematic modules are NOT copied.** The generic modules (animation, layout, routing, scroll,
  responsive, copy, testing, backend domains…) live **once, in the area**. The project's `index.md`
  **points to them** by relative path (`../../../lore/<module>.md`).
  > **Depth is three `../`, not two.** The referring file (`index.md`, `identidad.md`,
  > `principios.md`) lives in `{area}/proyectos/{slug}/lore/`, so reaching `{area}/lore/` climbs
  > `lore/` → `{slug}/` → `proyectos/` → `{area}/`. Do not "simplify" it to `../../lore/`.
- The project keeps only what is **its own**: `identidad.md` and `principios.md` that **lead with
  project-specific content** and **reference the area** for the shared standard, plus its `index.md`.
- Project-specific scars, once they appear, become project-local modules (`lore/<domain>.md`) via
  `save-to-lore`; generic + confirmed ones are promoted up to the area.

> This is a deliberate change from the old copy-everything approach: DRY beats autonomy here, so a
> fix to a generic clue in the area is seen by every project at once. If a project must be fully
> self-contained (e.g. handed off outside the area), run `transmute-lore` ADD to inline the area
> modules it depends on.

## Precondition

The target area exists and its `lore/` has at least `identidad.md` + `principios.md`. If the area
does not exist, **stop** and propose `create-area` first.

## Procedure (step by step)

### 1. Gather inputs (through Lore's `brainstorming-lore`, one at a time)

| Token | Where it comes from |
|---|---|
| `{{AREA_PATH}}` | path of the target area (e.g. `<root>/desarrollo-web`) |
| `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}` | project name in kebab-case (e.g. `acme`) |
| `{{DESCRIPTION}}` | one line: what the project is |
| `{{SOURCE_DOCS}}` | paths of the documents defining the project (spec PDF, brief, **free notes** the user already wrote about it…) |
| `{{INITIAL_PHASE}}` | active phase at start (derived from the source; see step 3) |
| `{{CONTRACT_FILE}}` | inherited from the Area's one contract: `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` |

### 2. Read context (MANDATORY before creating anything)

1. Read the area's one instruction contract and its Lore: `{{AREA_PATH}}/lore/identidad.md` +
   `principios.md` (+ `index.md` and any
   thematic modules that carry reusable criteria).
2. Read the area `FASES.md` (project registry) and prior projects' Lore/docs if they offer reusable
   criteria.
3. Check whether the area carries a **starter scaffold**: `{{AREA_PATH}}/_starter/`. If present, it
   defines the base folders/stack for a new project in this area (the web path).
4. **Read the source documents** (`{{SOURCE_DOCS}}`). If a PDF, extract text (`pdftotext -layout`)
   and locate: **objectives**, **content domains** (→ folders) and **timeline / deliverables /
   Gantt** (→ phases). The source wins over any tentative structure.
   **Free notes count as source documents** — a project often begins as a pile of them. They inform
   the structure and the identity; they are never copied into the Lore, and nothing in them is
   criteria until it is distilled. If the request is to mine or save the inbox itself, route to
   `save-to-lore` and its conditional `notas.md` function.

### 3. Project identity brainstorm (threshold)

Invoke Lore Plugin's own `brainstorming-lore` skill (`lore:brainstorming-lore` where skills are namespaced).
With what you read, propose and **get the user's approval** for:
- The project's **specific identity** (what it is, its own north, its anti-scope) — leads
  `identidad.md`, then a pointer to the area standard.
- The project's **specific principles** (its own constraints) — lead `principios.md`, then a pointer
  to the area laws.
- The **folder schema** derived from the source's domains (thematic, per-deliverable, or hybrid) —
  or the area starter's layout if `{area}/_starter/` exists.
- The **phase map** derived from the source's timeline/deliverables, and the initial **active phase**.

Apply `brainstorming-lore`'s **recognizable continuity** contract: carry each approved decision into
the accumulated project design and recap it at contextual milestones.

**Create no file before the design is approved.**

### 4. Create the structure

```bash
DEST="{{AREA_PATH}}/proyectos/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}"
mkdir -p "$DEST/lore"
```

- **If the area has a starter** (`{{AREA_PATH}}/_starter/`): instantiate it into `$DEST` (copy its
  versioned files; do not copy `node_modules`/build output/lockfiles so the stack resolves to its
  latest version). Then rename the project templates and adapt folders per the brainstorm:
  ```bash
  STARTER="{{AREA_PATH}}/_starter"
  cp -r "$STARTER/." "$DEST/"                          # templates + code scaffold (web/, …)
  for CONTRACT in CLAUDE AGENTS; do
    [ -f "$DEST/$CONTRACT.template.md" ] && mv "$DEST/$CONTRACT.template.md" "$DEST/$CONTRACT.md"
  done
  [ -f "$DEST/golden-paths.template.md" ] && mv "$DEST/golden-paths.template.md" "$DEST/golden-paths.md"
  # $DEST/FASES.md comes from the starter as-is; tokens are resolved in step 6.
  ```
- **Otherwise:** create the work folders derived from the source docs, each with a `.gitkeep`.

Resulting structure (folder names come from step 2/3):

```
{{AREA_PATH}}\proyectos\{{PROJECT_SLUG}}\
  {{CONTRACT_FILE}}    → the one project contract (pointers to lore/)
  FASES.md             → state + phase map derived from the source
  lore\
    index.md           → project Lore map: points to area modules (../../../lore/<module>.md)
    identidad.md       → project identity + pointer to area identidad
    principios.md      → project laws + pointer to area principios
    (if the area profile is enabled, this index carries its pointer)
  {{thematic / per-deliverable folders, empty with .gitkeep}}
  fuente\              → original source document(s) + extracted text
```

### 5. Write the inherited-but-DRY Lore

> The snippets below are **shape, not literal text**: render every heading, sentence AND
> localizable filename in the user's language (per the language rule above). Relative-path depth
> stays as-is, but path segments use the area's actual (localized) names.

Write the project's `lore/identidad.md`:

```markdown
# Identidad — {{PROJECT_TITLE}}

## Este proyecto
{{PROJECT_SPECIFIC_IDENTITY}}   # what it is, its own north, its anti-scope

## Estándar heredado del área
This project inherits the area's premium standard and quality floor.
Source of truth for the shared standard: [`../../../lore/identidad.md`](../../../lore/identidad.md).
```

**`registro:` is inherited, not re-decided.** A project takes the area's line and writes none of its
own; only add `registro:` here when the user says this project should read differently from the rest
of the area, and then it is inferred from how they said it — never asked. Everything about how the
calibrator behaves is in `use-lore`.

Write the project's `lore/principios.md`:

```markdown
# Principios — {{PROJECT_TITLE}}

## Leyes propias de este proyecto
{{PROJECT_SPECIFIC_PRINCIPLES}}

## Leyes heredadas del área
The area's invariant laws apply in full. Source of truth:
[`../../../lore/principios.md`](../../../lore/principios.md).
```

Write `lore/index.md` pointing to the area modules:

```markdown
# Índice del Lore — {{PROJECT_TITLE}}

## Fundamentos (project)
- Identidad — this project + inherited standard · [identidad.md](identidad.md)
- Principios — this project's laws + inherited laws · [principios.md](principios.md)

## Módulos heredados del área (por ruta relativa)
- Professional criterion · [../../../lore/perfil-profesional.md](../../../lore/perfil-profesional.md) _(only if it exists)_
- animation · [../../../lore/animation.md](../../../lore/animation.md)
- layout · [../../../lore/layout.md](../../../lore/layout.md)
- (…the area modules this project relies on…)

## Módulos propios del proyecto
_(none yet — created by save-to-lore when a project-specific scar appears)_
```

> Only list the area modules the project actually relies on. Project-specific clues get their own
> local module later, added by `save-to-lore`.

### 6. Write / resolve `{{CONTRACT_FILE}}` and `FASES.md`

- **If the area starter provided them** (step 4 renamed the contract template and left
  `FASES.md`): do NOT rewrite from scratch — **resolve their `{{TOKENS}}`** with the project's
  name/description and the phase map derived from the source docs.
- **Otherwise, write them with Write:**
  - `{{CONTRACT_FILE}}`: slimmed to pointers — where `lore/` lives, that thematic modules are inherited from
    the area by relative path, and the area's actual base rules; never invent a web-only rule for
    a non-web project.
  - `FASES.md`: **outside** `lore/`, with the phase map **derived from the source's timeline** and
    the initial active phase.

After either path, verify there is exactly one instruction contract and that its name matches the
Area. Do not create a second contract merely because another host might be used later.

**Stamp the always-on block** (project variant) in that contract — the pointer section wrapped in
`<!-- lore:always-on -->` / `<!-- /lore:always-on -->`, pointing at this project's own layer and its
mother area's, at its own `FASES.md` in one line, plus the signal to invoke instead of writing by
hand. The area starter template
already carries it; if the contract was written from scratch, add it. Rules, ceiling and the
idempotency table are in `use-lore` — this happens inside the threshold this skill already has, and
never as a second pass afterwards. If a block is already there and differs, report it and wait: a
human edit inside the block is a decision.

Resolve every `{{TOKEN}}` with what was discussed; leave none unresolved.

### 7. Verify and report

```bash
grep -rn '{{[A-Z_]\+}}' "$DEST" && echo "UNRESOLVED TOKENS" || echo "OK no tokens"
# every local index link resolves; area links point outside the project:
```

- Verify local `index.md` links resolve to present files, and the `../../../lore/<module>.md` links
  resolve to files in the area.
- Verify the stamped contract meets the starter **floor**: one always-on block, four things, ≤ 25
  lines; `FASES.md` outside `lore/`; modules inherited by relative path, not copied; no `HARD-GATE`
  in present tense; no plugin wrap. If the area is `bots`, stop and hand back to `create-bot` —
  that skill owns the bot variant, and the stamped bot declares what it loaded in one short line
  (Spanish canonical form: `Contrato, Lore y FASES cargados`) — only after the opening hook confirms
  by staying silent; if the hook speaks, repair first. Where no hook runs, open the three bodies
  yourself, then declare what you opened. The line goes in the user's language; what is
  fixed is the meaning and the three bodies.
- Verify exactly one of `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` exists. For cross-host use, offer Codex's
  `project_doc_fallback_filenames` setting or, only with explicit approval, a minimal adapter.
- Register the project in the **area's** `FASES.md` (row with path + status + internal phase).
- Report the created structure and the next step (start the active phase; optionally `git init`).

## Invariants

- The project ALWAYS lives in `{area}/proyectos/{slug}/`. `lore/` at its root; `FASES.md`
  **outside** `lore/` (criteria persists, state advances).
- **Thematic modules and, if it exists, `perfil-profesional.md` are referenced from the area, not duplicated** (DRY). Only `identidad.md`,
  `principios.md` and `index.md` are project-local Lore files at creation.
- **Read the source docs before** fixing folders and phases. Structure and phase map come from the
  source, not a mold.
- Project-specific identity/principles are BORN from the brainstorm, never from invented defaults.
- **Everything generated — content and artifact filenames — is in the user's language** (fixed
  selected contract name (`CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`) / `lore/` / `index.md` and general technical English terms excluded); the
  area's established names win inside its tree, and a language clash with the area is flagged —
  never resolved silently.
- No data, figures or deliverables are invented: they are derived from the source.
- **A paragraph is a paragraph** (kit invariant in `use-lore`): generated `lore/`, contract and
  `FASES.md` are not hard-wrapped at column 80.
- The project is NOT auto-committed. The user decides.
